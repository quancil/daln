        Might not be any special to most due to its basic drums yet the melody is very well written and creates a whole another vibe.
        Doesn't feel akward at no point and keeps the flow going. The mix is very clean and could easily get placements
        if exposed to a broader audience.

        The melody is incredibly catchy and the drums compliment it well. While being a good beat overall, the melody sounds quite thin
        which makes the instrumental a little akward to listen to standalone. Also the high end is quite heavily occupied by the lead
        which is not ideal for placements. The lead line is very memorable though and really makes up for it.

        I would not expect a mix of drill and plug go so well together, especially with the sad and nostalgic sounding chord progression
        and melodic line. Yet it sounds very good, and although I'm not the biggest fan of the 808 choice and pattern, it goes perfectly
        with some good vocals on it.

        The constant contrast between sections of the drums and melody create incredible tension and flow. The groove is on point and
        the melody is very catchy. Doesn't feel boring anytime throughout the whole beat and although the melody does not leave that
        much space for an artist though, it's still a bop.

        Great example of what a "calmer" yeat type beat should sound like. The melody is simple yet great sounding, the drum
        groove is on point and the mix is incredibly clean. Begs for a placement.

        The melody is something different for sure. Gives an incredible bounce with the added drums and make for one of the hardest
        hitting kankan type beats I've heard. The flow is insane and the distorted drums were handled very well in the mix.

        The melody is incredibly catchy and surprisingly nostalgic sounding considering the type of beat it is. The distorted 808s go
        perfect alongside the chords as well and make a perfect bounce together with the kick. The mix is very clean.

        Very groovy drums and catchy melody go perfectly together in this beat. The overall flow of the beat is incredible, it feels very chill yet fast-paced and groovy.
   
        The mix is on point, really begging for good vocals. The lead line might be a little too akward for my taste because of the odd placing of the plucks though.
     
        Very surprised it was marked as a *THROWAWAY*.

        Perfect, hard-hitting, not repetative drums make for a great support for one of the most catchy leads I've ever heard in a yeat type beat.
   
        The very subtle, yet great sounding bell pattern with glitch effects brilliantly supports the synths.
    
        Although its awesome sound it's not the most artist friendly with the melody taking up a lot of high end, hence didn't make it to no. 1.
     
        If we're not talking placements it's my favorite daln beat and perhaps my favorite free youtube instrumental as well.

        The very well written melody goes wonderful with the bouncy drums, along with percs and FX to really spice the groove up.
      
        The mix is very clean - the melody doesn't take up much high end which allows vocals to shine in the mix as well.
       
        That along with the overall flawless flow makes for an awesome sounding, bouncy, artist-friendly instrumental.
      
        Hands down one of the catchiest beats I've ever heard.

        Very clean mix and catchy lead. Has a lot of space for the artist to shine. I'm not the biggest fan of the second 808 though.

        The reverse melody makes for a great vibe together with the hard-hitting drums. The hi-hat pattern does wonders in the groove.
        I would say the 808s get muddy at times, hence I'd prefer a cleaner drum mix.
